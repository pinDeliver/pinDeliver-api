# Driver

Drivers are a crucial component in the delivery process and must be linked to a pre-existing delivery group to be created. Additionally, they may also be associated with a carrier if necessary. The creation of routes is not dependent on the availability of drivers but you can't start a route without a driver available. The API encompasses various functions for managing drivers, including adding, retrieving and deleting them.
