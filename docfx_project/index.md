# API-documentation

API (Application Programming Interface) documentation is a set of information and instructions that explain how to effectively use and integrate an API into a software application. It is an important tool for developers as it helps them understand the capabilities and limitations of the API, as well as how to properly make requests and handle responses.

API documentation typically includes information such as the endpoint URL, the types of requests that can be made (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), the format of the data that is expected in requests and responses, and any authentication or authorization requirements. It may also include code examples, tutorials, and best practices for using the API.
