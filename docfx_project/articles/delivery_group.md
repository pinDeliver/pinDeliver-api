# Delivery Group

It is advisable to start by establishing the delivery group, as it is a crucial step in the process. The delivery group can be easily managed with the ability to add, retrieve, update and delete delivery groups as needed. Without a properly set up delivery group, it is impossible to create either an order or a vehicle. The vehicle must be associated with the delivery group to create an optimized route, which, along with the order containing the customer and their packages, forms the foundation of pin-delivery's route optimization.
