# Route

To create a route, you need to have first created a vehicle. The route is linked to the vehicle and from there, multiple routes can be merged into a single order for one or more customers. The Route API offers a range of functionality, including adding, retrieving, updating, packaging and creating unit loads for packaging purposes.
