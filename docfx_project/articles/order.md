# Order

An order creation requires the presence of an existing delivery group as it must be linked to the order. To create an order, it's crucial to have a delivery group in place. To manage orders, you can add, retrieve, and import them. Each order can have one or multiple customers along with their packages, and one or multiple delivery routes can be assigned to the order.
