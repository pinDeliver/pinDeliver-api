# Vehicle

Vehicles are a crucial component in the delivery process and must be linked to a pre-existing delivery group to be created. Additionally, they may also be associated with a carrier if necessary. The creation of routes is dependent on the availability of vehicles. The API encompasses various functions for managing vehicles, including adding, retrieving, updating and deleting them.
