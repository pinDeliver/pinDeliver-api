<p>API (Application Programming Interface) documentation is a set of information and instructions that explain how to effectively use and integrate an API into a software application. It is an important tool for developers as it helps them understand the capabilities and limitations of the API, as well as how to properly make requests and handle responses.</p>
<p>API documentation typically includes information such as the endpoint URL, the types of requests that can be made (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), the format of the data that is expected in requests and responses, and any authentication or authorization requirements. It may also include code examples, tutorials, and best practices for using the API.</p>

<h1 id="workflow">Workflow</h1>
<p>The requests for sender and carrier are completely optional to create. There are already existing senders you can use when adding a customer order. Carrier can be used when creating a vehicle but it is not essential to make a vehicle work.
The request for vehicle type works in a similar way. It is optional to create and can be connected to a vehicle but it is not necessary to create it to make a vehicle work.</p>
<p>The other three requests on the left side, delivery group, driver and vehicle are non-optional but you still only need to create them one time. Once these three, and eventually sender, carrier and vehicle type, are created you don't need to use those requests anymore if you don't want to. If you want to you can connect the driver to one or more vehicles but that is completely optional.</p>
<p>The four requests one the right side of the chart below; routing order, customer order, package and route are requests that can be iterated for as many times as you need them.</p>
<p>A reasonable way to use our API-requests would be to start with, if you plan on using it, setting up a carrier.
Then continue with creating x amount of delivery groups, drivers and vehicles. After a vehicle is created you can proceed with creating a vehicle type and connect it to the vehicle.
Once a delivery group is created you can proceed with adding a routing order followed by a customer order with packages and eventually a sender in the same request.</p>
