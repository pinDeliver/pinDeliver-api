# Carrier

The carrier can be efficiently managed through the API, allowing for creation, retrieval, and deletion. It operates independently of any other API, however, it can be seamlessly linked to a [vehicle](vehicle.md) once it has been created. The use of a carrier is optional in the process of route optimization.
