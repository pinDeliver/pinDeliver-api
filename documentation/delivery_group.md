# Delivery Group

It is advisable to start by establishing the delivery group, as it is a crucial step in the process. The delivery group can be easily managed with the ability to add, retrieve, update and delete delivery groups as needed. Without a properly set up delivery group, it is impossible to create either an [routing order](order.md) or a [vehicle](vehicle.md). The vehicle must be associated with the delivery group to create an optimized [route](route.md), which, along with the routing order containing the [customer order](customer_order.md) and their packages, forms the foundation of pinDeliver's route optimization.
