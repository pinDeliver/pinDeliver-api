# Delivery Group

It is advisable to start by establishing the delivery group, as it is a crucial step in the process. The delivery group can be easily managed with the ability to add, retrieve, update and delete delivery groups as needed. Without a properly set up delivery group, it is impossible to create either an routing order or a vehicle. The vehicle must be associated with the delivery group to create an optimized route, which, along with the routing order containing the customer order and their packages, forms the foundation of pinDeliver's route optimization.
